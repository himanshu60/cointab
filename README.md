# Cointab:
Create a simple 2-Page website using Node.js and SQL database, Page 1 will have three
buttons namely Fetch Users, Delete Users, User Details, on clicking the Fetch Users button the
application should fetch data from the (https://randomuser.me/) api and store it in a table of any
name in the database, the data fetch should be in bulk for e.g., if the api returns a single record
then the application should be such a way that it will fetch around 50 or 100 records on a single
click.
